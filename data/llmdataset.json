    "answer": "1) **$\text{V}/\text{Q}$ $\text{Mismatch}$** (most common, e.g., $\text{PE}$, $\text{Pneumonia}$), 2) **$\text{Hypoventilation}$** (e.g., $\text{Opioid}$ $\text{Overdose}$), 3) **$\text{Shunt}$** (e.g., $\text{ARDS}$, $\text{Intracardiac}$ $\text{Shunt}$), and 4) **$\text{Diffusion}$ $\text{Impairment}$** (e.g., $\text{Pulmonary}$ $\text{Fibrosis}$)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the physiological definition of a **$\text{Shunt}$** in the lung?",
    "answer": "A Shunt is a complete failure of ventilation in an area that is still perfused ($\mathbf{V}/\mathbf{Q} = 0$). $\text{Shunts}$ are refractory (unresponsive) to $\mathbf{100\%}$ **$\text{Supplemental}$ $\text{Oxygen}$** because the blood bypasses the gas-exchange area entirely."

  {
    "question": "What is the formula for the **$\text{Alveolar}$-$\text{Arterial}$ ($\text{A}$-$\text{a}$) $\text{Gradient}$** and what does an elevated value indicate?",
    "answer": "Formula: $\text{A}$-$\text{a}$ $\text{Gradient} = \text{P}_{\text{A}}\text{O}_2 - \text{P}_{\text{a}}\text{O}_2$ (where $\text{P}_{\text{A}}\text{O}_2$ is $\text{Alveolar}$ $\text{O}_2$). An **$\text{Elevated}$** $\text{A}$-$\text{a}$ $\text{Gradient}$ indicates a problem in the **$\text{Gas}$ $\text{Exchange}$ $\text{Unit}$** itself (e.g., $\text{V}/\text{Q}$ $\text{Mismatch}$, $\text{Shunt}$, $\text{Fibrosis}$), ruling out pure $\text{Hypoventilation}$ as the cause of $\text{Hypoxemia}$."

  {
    "question": "What is the key principle of $\text{Mechanical}$ $\text{Ventilation}$ management in $\text{ARDS}$?",
    "answer": "The key principle is **$\text{Lung}$ $\text{Protective}$ $\text{Ventilation}$**, which involves using **$\text{Low}$ $\text{Tidal}$ $\text{Volumes}$** to prevent **$\text{Barotrauma}$** (damage from high pressure) and using high levels of **$\text{Positive}$ $\text{End}$-$\text{Expiratory}$ $\text{Pressure}$ ($\text{PEEP}$)** to keep alveoli open."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is **$\text{Pulmonary}$ $\text{Embolism}$ ($\text{PE}$)?**",
    "answer": "$\text{PE}$ is the **$\text{Obstruction}$** of a $\text{Pulmonary}$ $\text{Artery}$ (or one of its branches) by a $\text{Thrombus}$ ($\text{Clot}$), most often originating from a $\text{Deep}$ $\text{Vein}$ $\text{Thrombosis}$ ($\text{DVT}$) in the legs."

  },
  {
    "question": "What is the physiological mechanism linking chronic $\text{Hypoxemia}$ to $\text{Pulmonary}$ $\text{Hypertension}$?",
    "answer": "Chronic $\text{Hypoxemia}$ causes **$\text{Hypoxic}$ $\text{Pulmonary}$ $\text{Vasoconstriction}$** (a protective mechanism to shunt blood away from poorly ventilated areas). When this is widespread (as in $\text{COPD}$), it leads to increased $\text{Vascular}$ $\text{Resistance}$ and, eventually, $\text{Pulmonary}$ $\text{Hypertension}$."

    "question": "What is the difference between a **$\text{Pneumothorax}$** and a **$\text{Tension}$ $\text{Pneumothorax}$**?",
    "answer": "A $\text{Pneumothorax}$ is air in the $\text{Pleural}$ $\text{Space}$. A **$\text{Tension}$ $\text{Pneumothorax}$** occurs when the air acts as a **$\text{One}$-$\text{Way}$ $\text{Valve}$**—air enters the $\text{Pleural}$ $\text{Space}$ during inspiration but cannot escape. This buildup of pressure causes tracheal deviation and hemodynamic compromise (a medical emergency)."
